Personal Portfolio Website

As part of my task-based internship, I developed a Personal Portfolio Website to showcase my skills, projects, certificates, and contact details in a structured and professional way. The main objective of this project was to create a responsive and user-friendly portfolio that represents my profile as a Computer Science student and aspiring software developer.

The portfolio website was developed using HTML and CSS, with a focus on clean design and smooth user experience. HTML was used to structure different sections of the website such as Home, About, Skills, Certificates, Projects, and Contact. CSS was used to style the layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance of the website. Google Fonts were also used to improve the visual look of the site.

The Home section introduces my profile and gives a brief overview of my interests and technical background. The About section provides detailed information about my education and career goals. The Skills section highlights my technical skills such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java, MySQL, and GitHub, along with relevant icons for better understanding.

The Certificates section displays the certifications I have earned from different platforms, which helps showcase my learning and achievements. The Projects section includes details of the projects I have worked on, along with links to GitHub repositories, allowing users to view my work directly. This makes the portfolio more interactive and informative.

The Contact section includes a contact form that allows users to send messages directly through the website. Social media links such as GitHub, LinkedIn, and email are also provided, making it easy for others to connect with me. The website is designed to be responsive and works smoothly across different screen sizes and devices.

While working on this project, I learned how to design and organize a complete website using HTML and CSS. I also gained experience in structuring content, improving UI design, and maintaining proper code organization. This project helped me improve my front-end development skills and understand the importance of having a professional online presence.

Overall, developing the Personal Portfolio Website was a valuable learning experience. It helped me apply my theoretical knowledge in a practical way and enhanced my confidence in web development. This project plays an important role in presenting my skills and projects professionally and is a significant part of my internship learning experience.
